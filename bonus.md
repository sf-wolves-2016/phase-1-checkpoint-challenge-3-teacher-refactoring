Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)


# These questions were answered by me before .. :) Just added couple more lines ..

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?

Fetch` is useful because we can give as many keys and values to the object we make ..
And we will have an arguement error if we dont pass anything .
The attribute will stay nil ..


2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?

It saves a lot of time while coding .. You do not need to repeat yourself in every insances if you have a parent class ..




3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?

They were initialized with an option hash to make the user create instances with given amount of arguments ..





4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

`Private' means it is only accessible in the class itself ..





5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
