# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
Hash.fetch returns the value for the given key.  If a key can't be found and no arguments or default it given it will raise a KeyError.  If a default or argument is provided it will be run when a value cannot be found.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?
The disadvantage of single inheritance is that you can only have one superclass per class.

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?
Private makes methods unaccessible from outside of the object.

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
